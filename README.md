Energy Consumption Monitoring Dashboard
This project demonstrates how to monitor energy consumption patterns across various departments to identify inefficiencies and recommend optimizations using Python and Power BI.

Features
Data Simulation:

Generates a mock dataset simulating energy consumption, associated costs, and efficiency percentages for different departments.
Visualizations:

Bar Chart: Energy consumption by department.
Scatter Plot: Relationship between energy costs and consumption.
Heatmap: Correlation analysis to uncover patterns and inefficiencies.
Exported Dataset:

The simulated data is saved as mock_energy_consumption_data.csv for use in Power BI or other tools.
Power BI Dashboard:

An interactive dashboard built using the exported dataset allows users to drill down into insights, apply filters, and identify actionable opportunities.
